🔥 darling-stats-preview-card

🚀 FrontEnd-Mentor-Challenge 

🧔 Hi everyone, it's me again, and I wanted to share a repository I've been working on. I created a stats-preview-card using React.js props because I wanted to practice it once again. I'm really dedicated to improving my skills! Just to add, I incorporated some animations between the text and the container. That's all for now. Thank you, and mabuhay!
